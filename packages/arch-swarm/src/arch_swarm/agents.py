"""Agent role definitions for architecture debates.

Each role is a perspective that an agent brings to the brainstorming table.
Roles are represented as data (prompt templates / descriptions) rather than
executable agents -- the orchestrator feeds them to an LLM or uses them as
lenses for automated analysis.
